## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Node.js & npm
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- MySQL

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd alumni-connect
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Set the required environment variables before starting the backend. The main application uses MySQL and Flyway; H2 is reserved for tests.

```powershell
$env:DB_URL="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/alumni_connect"
$env:DB_USERNAME="root"
$env:DB_PASSWORD="your_mysql_password"
$env:MAIL_USERNAME="your_email@gmail.com"
$env:MAIL_PASSWORD="your_gmail_app_password"
$env:JWT_SECRET="a_random_secret_at_least_32_characters_long"
```

Create the database once if it does not exist:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE alumni_connect CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Backend runs on:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd alumni-connect-ui
npm install
ng serve
```

Frontend runs on:
```
http://localhost:4200
```
